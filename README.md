## Bugs and feature requests

Have a bug or a feature request? Please search for existing and closed issues. If your problem or idea is not addressed yet, [please open a new issue](https://github.com/jfox015/Serenity/issues/new).


## Documentation

Serenity documentation will become available as key features are locked down and releases are made. Stay Tuned.

## Compiling CSS and JavaScript

Serenity uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) with convenient methods for working with the framework. It's how code is compiled. To use it, install the required dependencies as directed and then run some Grunt commands.

### Install Grunt

From the command line:

1. Install `grunt-cli` globally with `npm install -g grunt-cli`.
2. Navigate to the root `/serenity` directory, then run `npm install`. npm will look at [package.json](https://github.com/jfox015/serenity/package.json) and automatically install the necessary local dependencies listed there.

When completed, you'll be able to run the various Grunt commands provided from the command line.

**Unfamiliar with npm? Don't have node installed?** That's a-okay. npm stands for [node packaged modules](http://npmjs.org/) and is a way to manage development dependencies through node.js. [Download and install node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) before proceeding.


### Troubleshooting dependencies

Should you encounter problems with installing dependencies or running Grunt commands, uninstall all previous dependency versions (global and local). Then, rerun `npm install`.
